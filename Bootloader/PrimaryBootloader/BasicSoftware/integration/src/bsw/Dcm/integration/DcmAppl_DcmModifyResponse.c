 *  This function is provided to allow the application to conditionally modify the responses from all the services.
 *  a) For negative response, the application can modify only the NRC value.
    b) For positive response, application can add only the additional bytes to the response. But modification of the contents filled by the service is not allowed.
    c) Application is not allowed to transform the positive response to  the negative response and vice versa.\n
    d) If the project does not want the modification of the response, the Appl function need not be modified and can be retained as it is. But the *nrBufSize_pu32 (modified response length)
       has to be made zero explicitly.

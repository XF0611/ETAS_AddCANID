 WdgM Report
================

    
Deadline Supervision is used (configured).
        
Mcu Api is used to access timer required for Deadline Supervision
Api used: Mcu_Rb_GetSysTicks()
        
    


General Settings as per current Ecuc Value Configuration:

Is Deadline Supervision TimeOut Detection in WdgM_MainFunction Enabled? :  Yes.
Is Development Error Detection Enabled? :  Yes.
Is DEM Failure reporting enabled? :  No.
Is it configured to Reset immediately through MCU RESET when WdgM detects failure? :   No.
Is it allowed through WdgM configuration to Disable the Watchdog? :   No.
Is Version Info Api Generated? :  No.
Number Of Watchdogs configured: 2
Number of Supervised Entity configured: 1

The Alive Supervision function with more than one checkpoint per Supervised Entity is not consistently specified within the SWS document of Watchdog Manager.
For now it is recommended in the limitation section of the SWS to support only one alive supervision checkpoint per Supervision Entity.

Number of Alive Supervisions supported per Supervised Entity: 1 (for more details please refer WdgM specification 4.2.2 Limitation section 4.1)

WdgM Code generated using Current Configuration Class: PreCompileTime

....!!!!


Warning: WdgMSupervisionCycle is precompile time configurabe parameter. If other WdgMSupervisionCycle
Values are required then WdgM has to be recompiled along with full system Recompilation. For more details
please refer the following:
1. Bugzilla: "http://www.autosar.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50418"
2. Description: "ecuc_sws_3046" of "Specification of ECU Configuration V3.2.0 R4.0 Rev 3"

Following are the possible WdgMSupervisionCycle's available
for future additional postbuild WdgMConfigSet's, without precompiling the full system:

[1]			---			 1         (ms)


RTE Support: Enabled
Number of provided Mode Ports: 1
Number of provided Alive Ports: 1
Global Mode Port: Present

Following are the constants expected to be generated in "SchM_WdgM_Type.h" for WdgMSupervisionCycle Switch by RTE.

[1]			---			RTE_TRANSITION_WdgMSupervisionCycle
[2]			---			RTE_MODE_WdgMSupervisionCycle_SUPERVISION_CYCLE_0


WdgM uses
FUNC(uint8 , RTE_CODE) SchM_Mode_WdgM_Current_WdgMSupervisionCycle(void);
and
FUNC(Std_ReturnType , RTE_CODE) SchM_Switch_WdgM_WdgMSupervisionCycle(uint8 data);
Api, Generated by RTE to request Mode switch for the corresponding WdgMSupervisionCycle's to SchM.


Note 1: WdgM_MainFunction shall be mapped to that task where no Supervised Entity Checkpoints are configured. This is to satisfy the Requirement:
        [WDGM275] The OS task which is executing the main function WdgM_MainFunction shall be separated from the OS task(s) calling any function
        from a Supervised Entity under supervision.

Note 2: If WdgM is initialized before SchM, then WdgM_MainFunction should be called manually by INTEGRATOR at the specified period in the EcuM
        callout functions. Otherwise Watchdog Induced RESET may happen, because generally the WdgMTriggerConditionValue is configured only 1ms more
        than the WdgMSupervisionCycle Value which determines the Period of WdgM_MainFunction....!!
        According to comment 10 of Bugzilla reference: http://www.autosar.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54369.
